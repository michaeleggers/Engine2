# Engine2
A small engine with SDL2/OpenGL using the MD2 format from Quake2 to render animated 3D models.

***About***

My first ever try using OpenGL in order to learn it in 2016.

It loads models from .md2 files and animates the model's keyframes via linear interpolation on the GPU.
This project uses a lot of OOP since at that time I bought very much into the idea of it. So, the code's
quality is questionable at best.

***Building***
The project was updated to VS 2017 and will build for x86.


***What it does***
